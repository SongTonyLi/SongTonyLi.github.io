            "method": "Selection by hand with plt.ginput. Important facial keypoints, such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, nostrils, are selected",
            "explanation": "Delauney is created by cv.Subdiv2D on selected points. It's pretty interesting to observe that East Asian people have somewhat more planar to look. and even the triangularization is cleaner and no triangles are really thin."

            "explanation": "Basically, for each triangle, we do affine transformation + color cross-dissolve. In this part, both original pictures have roughly same frequencies, so the resulting image would not look like one person if close up another if far way. The mid-way image looks very interesting, and it's capturing two person's features. For example, my short hair with his eyes."

            "explanation": "The average face has really distinctive eyes but it's hard to detect if she's smiling or not. Also, due to repeated morphing, the overall frequencies are reduced on edges, and this why the resulting is blurrier. A small high-pass filter is applied to the average face to make it look better."
